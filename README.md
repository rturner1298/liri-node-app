# liri-node-app
*LIRI Bot*
LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.
To retrieve the data that will power this app, you'll need to send requests using the axios package to the Bands in Town, Spotify and OMDB APIs. 

*Uses for LIRI Bot*
Use the LIRI bot to search for:
- upcoming concerts using the command: concert-this "insert artist you want to search" 
- movie information using the command: movie-this "insert movie you want to search"
- song information using the command: spotify-this-song "insert song you want to search"
Note that quotations are needed for artists movies, and songs longer than 1 word.
